# BeerJS Hudson

![BeerJS - Bacon not included!](./images/beerjs-bacon.jpg)

BeerJS Hudson is a gathering group for Hudson County JavaScripters (NYC JavaScripters and visitors welcomed!) to get together for activities revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript!  Currently we organize events at [meetup.com/Hudson-County-JavaScript-Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hudson-County-JavaScript-Meetup), but we're experimenting here as well.

## Why Github?

* Github is a more natural social network for a group of developers than Meetup.com.  
* Less spam
* Because Github is free and [Meetup.com is not](http://www.meetup.com/help/Does-it-cost-money-to-start-a-Meetup-Group), which means more beer money!

## Organizers

* Carlos Justiniano ([Github](https://github.com/cjus) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjus))
