BeerJS JC
=========

BeerJS JC is a gathering group for Jersey City JavaScripters (NYC JavaScripters and visitors welcomed!) to get together for activities revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript!  Currently we organize events at [meetup.com/Jersey-City-JavaScript-Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Jersey-City-JavaScript-Meetup), but we're experimenting here as well.

Why Github?
-----------

* Github is a more natural social network for a group of developers than Meetup.com.  
* Less spam
* Because Github is free and [Meetup.com is not](http://www.meetup.com/help/Does-it-cost-money-to-start-a-Meetup-Group), which means more beer money!
